# Week 8 Combined Laboratory Assignment

Week 8 paired two JavaScript exercises: the Welcome Portal validation challenge and the Rock, Paper, Scissors mini-game. This repo hosts both on a single page so their conditional logic is easy to compare.

## Exercises

1. **Welcome Portal Validation** – captures a visitor’s name and age, enforces the Sam rule, and shows contextual cards. Blocked visitors can optionally open a mock quiz or a video via buttons.
2. **Rock, Paper, Scissors Game** – lets approved visitors play against the computer, updating running win/lose/tie counts with basic `if` / `else if` branching.

## Project Layout

- `index.html` – main HTML view containing both modules.
- `css/style.css` – shared layout, spacing, and component styles.
- `js/script.js` – input validation, gating logic, and RPS gameplay.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2. Complete the Welcome Portal form. Adults who are not named Sam unlock the game; everyone else stays on the page and may click the quiz or video buttons if they want more practice.
3. After approval, pick moves in the Rock, Paper, Scissors area, watch the scoreboard update, and use Reset to clear totals.

## Technical Focus

The code highlights foundational JavaScript topics: if statements (basic syntax), `else if` ladders, logical operators, nesting, DOM querying, event handling, and simple state management.
